2. Long-term memory (persistent storage)
3. Episodic memory (experience-based learning)
4. Semantic memory (knowledge graphs)

### Rationale
- **Learning Capability**: Enables continuous improvement from interactions
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains conversation and campaign context
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies successful strategies for reuse
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Semantic memory enables cross-agent learning

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Improved performance over time, better personalization
- **Negative**: Increased memory usage, complexity in memory management
